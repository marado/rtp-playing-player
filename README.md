# RTP Playing Player

RTP Play was a bad site.
One day, it was changed to a worse site.
Nowadays, it is a totally unusable site.

This script was made so that, given a link to rtp play (a specific program), it will let you actually see the program.

PS - If you're looking to see RTP *live*, check out https://github.com/marmelo/streaming-pt .

# Usage

```
rpp.sh http://www.rtp.pt/play/p1781/e207243/voz-do-cidadao
```
(Replace the link to the one for the program you actually want to see)
