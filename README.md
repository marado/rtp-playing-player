# RTP Playing Player

RTP Play was a bad site.
One day, it was changed to a worse site.
Then, it became totally unusable site.

This script was made so that, given a link to rtp play (a specific program), it would let you actually see the program.

PS - If you're looking to see RTP *live*, check out https://github.com/marmelo/streaming-pt .

# Usage

```
rpp.sh http://www.rtp.pt/play/p1781/e207243/voz-do-cidadao
```
(Replace the link to the one for the program you actually want to see)

# Deprecated

While I will let this repository stay here for archival purposes, the site changed once again, and this script no longer works. However, [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) now works well on RTP's website, so I suggest you use it instead.
